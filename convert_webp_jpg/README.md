# Converting WEBP -> JPG

Simply as that. The only dependency needed is to have the package **dwebp** installed.

## Usage
```bash
chmod +x main.sh # Given permission to the script
./main.sh <dir>, e.g:
./main.sh ~/Downloads/images/
```
## TO DO: 
Make it work on external disks, like an external HDD.
