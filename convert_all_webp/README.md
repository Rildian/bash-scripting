# Convert png, jpg... -> webp
Why? Well, the purpose of this script actually is to access a folder of obsidian (where you store your images) and convert all of them to webp, so that don't consume too much storage. To use this script, you need to have **cwebp** installed. Also, if you want to just convert images from a directory, just execute the "convert_media_webp.sh"

## Usage
First, give permission to "permission.sh", so that you can give permission to the others scripts instead of manually do it.
```
chmod +x permission.sh
```
